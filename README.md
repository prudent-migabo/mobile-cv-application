# mobile cv application

This is Task-2 of HNG internship. It is a Mobile Application serving as a comprehensive cv.

- The first step is to install the app,
- After installing and open the app you are going to see a page containing my full name, my slack user name, a github handle and a brief personal biography.
- On the same page we have a button labelled "Edit information" which redirectes you to a new page where you can edit information provided on the previous page.
- The second page contains different text fields to edit information and a button labelled "Save" which automatically update the previous page with new provided data.
